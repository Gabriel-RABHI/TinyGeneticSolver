# TinyGeneticSolver

This library is a simplified implementation of an machine learning algorythm, the Genetic Algorythm. It mimics the biological sellection process to find the most efficient parameters of a system.

Imagine you have a system that generate outputs from inputs. This system have a set of parameters that change computations. This parameters permit to tune she system to make it efficient. The efficiency of a parameters set can be measured using a test function that score the output. If there is ont single parameter with four possible values, you can test each value to find the parameter value that make the best output. If you have many parameters with lot of possible values, you may have an infinit values combinations.

To find the best parameter set, you can try to scan a subset of parameter values.
